                Android 16 (人じん造ぞう人にん間げん１６号ごう Jinzōningen Jū Roku-Gō) is Dr. Gero's sixteenth Android creation, whose template was Gevo. <br> He was initially designed to serve Gero's vendetta against Goku, who overthrew the Red Ribbon Army as a child but is later deemed unfit for activation.

                Despite his intimidating size, monotone dialogue, and seemingly dangerous appearance, Android 16 is calm, friendly, and embraces nature and humanity, aside from a cold and distant attitude towards Goku in particular, since he was initially programmed to eliminate him.<br> He does not tolerate evil and described Cell as an existence whose purpose is to destroy life, especially nature and animals (as Cell is the true evil destroying android that posed a destructive intention to the Earth and its inhabitants of the present timeline, not himself, 17 and 18).<br> He is also protective of whomever he considers his friends, and nature, as he tried to ask Android 17 or 18 to run and hide somewhere and not be absorbed by Cell, even fighting the imperfect bio-android, although these proved futile, as 17's cockiness got the better of him, causing his absorption, and his damaged body and Semi-Perfect Cell's power too much for him, leaving him unable to protect 18, also resulting in her own absorption, and these qualities proved him to be a valuable ally to the Dragon Team in their battle against Cell.<br> He and his fellow android, 17, had a somewhat brother-like relationship.<br> It is likely that 16's nature-loving character inspired 17 to become a park ranger himself after his resurrection, changing his demeanor to undergo a calm, mature, gentleman-like persona, who is willing to sacrifice himself to defend the surrounding animals from whosoever tries to harm them.<br><br> 16's peaceful qualities led to a surprising affinity with Goku's son Gohan.<br> In Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, Android 16 firmly states that he is only after Goku, not his offspring, and even requests Gohan to assist him in a field test of his newly repaired body.<br> When both are in the forest, 16 feeding some deer catches Gohan's eye, and the two begin to bond over their shared love of animals.<br> 16 believes Gohan possesses a fine goal in becoming what he believes will be an exemplary scholar.<br> Despite 16's belief that he is a defective failure due to not possessing the bold and daring qualities his human template Gevo did, Gohan thinks otherwise.<br> Their newfound friendship leads to a team-up against poachers seeking the furs of the nearby deer, with Gohan and 16 sending them packing.<br> Once they are victorious, 16 ends up thanking Gohan for his assistance in battle as well as for helping to repair him, then reveals that the real reason he asked Gohan to accompany him was to evaluate Gohan's strength by fighting the Saiyan himself, but recognizes there was no longer a need, remarking that Gohan's immense power surpassed all of his system's records.<br> Despite Gohan thinking that his father is way stronger, 16 believes that the boy will be the deciding factor in the Cell Games, and remarks that the two of them are not so different after all.<br> During the Cell Games, 16's words prove true, as in his dying moments he becomes the catalyst for Gohan's ascension, using his words inspiring Gohan to stop holding back and awaken his true power.<br><br> Even though was programmed to kill Goku, 16 is not truly hateful of him.<br> In Xenoverse 2, Android 16 reveals that he recognizes that Goku is a noble person and admits that he would prefer to be free of his programming.<br> In FighterZ, the new model of Android 16 did end up not retaining his program to kill Goku when Android 21 transferred his memory into the new body, which he notes when he confronts a Goku Clone.
