            <h2> King Piccolo</h2>
            <p>

                King Piccolo (ピッコロ大だい魔ま王おう Pikkoro Daimaō, lit. "Great Demon King Piccolo"), sometimes referred to just as the Daimaou (大だい魔ま王おう Daimaō, lit. "Great Demon King") is a Demonic Namekian who once precipitated the Earth into utter mayhem and pandemonium,[4] spawning an army of demonic offspring and converting the peaceful planet into a living hell. <br> Later, it is revealed that he was the evil counterpart of Kami as King Piccolo and Kami were originally a single entity who had long forgotten his true name, and witnessed the evil deeds of humans while growing up. <br> When the nameless learned of the Guardian of the Earth and that its role could be passed down, he sought the title and position, but the then-Guardian rejected him, as he knew that the Namekian's heart was not completely pure and like most people he had some level of malice, jealousy, vanity and impurity in his heart. <br> Knowing that he would only be accepted for the role if his heart was pure, the Namekian split himself into two beings: his good half, Kami, and his evil half that would later become the great demon king, Piccolo. <br>

He served as the main antagonist of the King Piccolo Saga.

Thanks to his usage of the Pokopen ability, King Piccolo was able to "reincarnate" himself as Piccolo Jr. (ピッコロ・ジュニア Pikkoro Junia).

                Being the concentrated evil that lived within the Nameless Namekian, King Piccolo's personality is the exact opposite of his good counterpart, Kami;<br> as he is presented as a cold, ruthless, sadistic, and power-hungry villain with little to no sense of compassion whatsoever.<br> He has demonstrated on many occasions that he is willing to do anything to accomplish his goals, regardless of how many innocent lives need to be taken in the process.<br> Piccolo has also been shown to have a very warped and twisted sense of humor, often breaking out into a maniacal laughter after causing some form of death and destruction and creating a holiday where he would destroy a city every year on the anniversary of his take-over.<br> Despite his power-hungry nature, however, he has absolutely no interest in actually ruling over his subjects, at least after his release from the electric rice cooker by Pilaf.<br> This was especially evident after he took over the world, where he outright admits that he has no interest in ruling over the planet despite his being the new king of the world and if anything encourages the subjects to do all the crimes they ever want while explicitly ending law and order.<br><br> Along with being extremely evil, Piccolo is also very arrogant, believing himself to be the most powerful being in the universe, and up until he was defeated by Goku, he was one hundred percent convinced that there was no one out there who could exceed his power.<br> For all his many displays of arrogance, however, he was completely terrified of the Evil Containment Wave due to suffering its effects before, and completely freezes in horror the very moment it is performed.<br> As a result, he made it his sole mission to eliminate all martial artists that either knew how or had the capacity to use it.<br> He also believed that he and his sons were superior to Earthlings, though he himself, like Kami, was unaware of his Namekian origins, as he referred to both himself and his sons as Demons (however he is shown to be aware of his Namekian origins in certain video games).
