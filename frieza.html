            <h2>Frieza</h2>

                Frieza (フリーザ Furīza, lit. "Freeza") is a major antagonist in the Dragon Ball franchise. <br> He is the descendant of Chilled, the youngest son of King Cold, the younger brother of Cooler and the father of Kuriza. <br>

Inheriting his father’s imperialist army and rising to power as the emperor of Universe 7 at a young age, Frieza quickly established himself as a ruthless tyrant, feared across the universe for his unparalleled cruelty and power. <br> Ever since his invasion of Namek, Frieza has been the series' most recurring villain, clashing with his archnemesis Goku and his allies on several occasions, becoming even more powerful every time. <br>

Frieza is primarily responsible for the Genocide of the Saiyans and serves as the main antagonist of the overarching Frieza and Golden Frieza sagas, as well as a villainous protagonist during the Universe Survival Saga.

                Unlike most primary antagonists, Frieza displays a civilized and refined demeanor, talking with a regal and eloquent nature.<br> He even utilizes the Keigo dialect in the Japanese versions, which utilizes exceptionally respectful and formal phraseology.<br> In the original and remastered dubs for Dragon Ball Z, while his polite demeanor is somewhat retained (such as his quipping when threatening the Nameks in his introduction that he neglected his manners and should have added "please" to his threat to them), it also ends up downplayed by emphasizing his more brutal nature.<br> He tends to handle most situations with a systematic approach.<br> He commonly utilizes dark humor, making twisted jokes and tasteless mockery of his foes before killing them.<br> Frieza is fully aware of his reputation for brutality and makes no effort to deny it, but instead revels in it as evidenced by his introduction to the Namekians.<br> Likewise, he has shown great anger at the idea of his cruel deeds being undone, such as the revival of all his previous victims from the Dragon Balls.<br> Frieza can be best summed up as an intelligent, composed (for the most part), yet extraordinarily sadistic and completely heartless sociopath.<br> His final form's character biography in Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2 states that Frieza has unparalleled cruelty.<br> He has even been commonly referred to as "The evilest guy in Universe 7".<br> In Cooler's Revenge, Goku, when condemning Cooler, noted that Frieza was "filled with hatred."<br><br> While Frieza himself never attempted to kill either his father or brother during his lifetime and will work together with them to deal with threats to their family's reign (as shown in the Trunks Saga, Plan to Eradicate Super Saiyans, and Xenoverse 2), he has hardly any real love or attachment to them, and even scoffs at the notion of reviving his father when Sorbet suggested it in both Resurrection ‘F’ and Dragon Ball Super.<br> This is further shown when Universe 9 Supreme Kai Ro asks why Frieza would willingly betray Universe 7, asking him about any memories or loved ones Frieza may have, Frieza only coldly dismisses him, saying he has no idea what he is talking about, causing Ro to label Frieza a psychopath when discussing the possibility of Frieza joining Team Universe 9 with Sidra.<br> While he has no real love for his family, he is proud of his clan and respected his father during his lifetime, as he took his father's warning about never opposing either Beerus or Majin Buu seriously.<br> While they can work together, Frieza and Cooler have a strong sibling rivalry, and it is implied that they would at some point have come into conflict over control of the universe, were it not for Frieza's defeat on Namek.<br> In Dragon Ball Super: Broly, he is shown to be mildly annoyed when his father affectionately pats him on the back when they are on Planet Vegeta, showing his general dislike for affection, even from his father.<br> Despite this, he does refer to his father as "loving" when mentioning that Goku was the first time someone other than his parents managed to inflict pain onto his final form, though he may have been using the term sarcastically.<br><br> Frieza is shown to be something of a perfectionist, expecting nothing less from his soldiers as any failure in his eyes will be met with extreme punishment if not death.<br> Even more, he has absolutely no qualms with slaughtering his own forces, no matter how loyal to him, simply for being in his way, as seen from when he destroyed Planet Vegeta despite most of his men being within the trajectory, as well as his reason in the Japanese version for executing a soldier before deciding to personally deal with Future Trunks.<br> In addition, in Resurrection 'F', when executing Tagoma by shooting him out into space, he also made no attempt at activating the secondary window to save his forces from being sucked into the vacuum of space (with only Sorbet doing so).<br> He also reacts violently to criticism or if his plans either fail or if his pride is abashed.
