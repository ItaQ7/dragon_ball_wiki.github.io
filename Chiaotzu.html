                Chiaotzu, also known as Chaoz (餃チャオ子ズ Chaozu) in the original Japanese version, is the constant companion and best friend of Tien Shinhan and one of Master Shen's former students.

            <p>
                In his initial characterization, Chiaotzu is sadistic and amoral due to the teachings of Master Shen.<br> During the preliminary rounds of the tournament, he needlessly burns one of his opponents so badly that the man is bandaged from head to toe.<br> He gleefully inflicts pain on Krillin with his psychic attack and uses the same attack to cheat in Tien's match with Goku, on Shen's order.

Later, Chiaotzu is a fairly quiet but brave psychic martial artist who is willing to help out his friends whenever possible and is highly devoted to his training with Tien.<br> He will normally follow Tien every step of the way, but if he truly feels what he is doing is right, Chiaotzu will ignore Tien's rejections or even pleas in order to commit to the plan he has conjured up.<br> Despite being quiet and powerful, he also has a childish nature; mocking Krillin for shortcomings that Chiaotzu himself has when they first meet.<br> He has demonstrated an inability to quickly solve basic addition problems or grasp some jokes.<br> He enjoys watching movies and eating tenshindon (Which is ironically the dish that Tien Shinhan was named for).
